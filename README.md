# PNGCS

A small library to read/write huge PNG files in C#.

This project has been moved to [OneDotNet](https://dev.azure.com/zhangshuai89/Public/_git/OneDotNet?path=%2Fsrcs%2Fpublic%2Flib%2FPngcs&version=GTrelease%2FHjg.Pngcs%2Fv1.3.1&_a=contents). But you can still file me issues in this repository.

## Overview

PngCs is a C# library to read/write PNG images.

It provides a simple API for progressive (sequential line-oriented) reading and writing. It's specially suitable for huge images, which one does not want to load fully in memory.

## Installation

Install the NuGet package:

```powershell
dotnet add package IO.Github.Hcoona.Pngcs
```

Or via Package Manager Console:

```powershell
Install-Package IO.Github.Hcoona.Pngcs
```

## Features

- **Modern .NET support**: Multi-targeting for `netstandard2.0`, `netstandard2.1`, `net8.0`, and `net9.0`
- **Native AOT compatibility**: Full support for Native Ahead-of-Time compilation
- Supports all PNG spec color models and bitdepths:
  - RGB8/RGB16/RGBA8/RGBA16
  - G8/4/2/1
  - GA8/4/2/1
  - PAL8/4/2/1
- All filters/compression settings
- Support for Chunks (metadata)
- **API Compatibility**: API aligned with `Hjg.Pngcs` v1.1.4. See `CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` for details.
- **Note**: Does not support interlaced images

## Origin

This is a port of the [PngJ library (Java)](http://code.google.com/p/pngj/). The API, documentation and samples from PNGJ apply also to this PngCs library: <http://code.google.com/p/pngj/wiki/Overview>
