# PNGCS

A small library to read/write huge PNG files in C#.

## Overview

PngCs is a C# library to read/write PNG images.

It provides a simple API for progressive (sequential line-oriented) reading and writing. It's specially suitable for huge images, which one does not want to load fully in memory.

## Installation

Install the NuGet package:

```powershell
dotnet add package IO.Github.Hcoona.Pngcs
```

Or via Package Manager Console:

```powershell
Install-Package IO.Github.Hcoona.Pngcs
```

## Features

- All filters/compression settings

## Origin

This is a port of the [PngJ library (Java)](http://code.google.com/p/pngj/). The API, documentation and samples from PNGJ apply also to this PngCs library: <http://code.google.com/p/pngj/wiki/Overview>
